Everything went flawlessly i've got ome problem with android studio AVD. I had to manually install AMD drivers.

After that I learned the basics of Flutter and dart following the Flutter getting started

## developpement of the apps

I wish I had more time to learn how to user Material Theme properly to theme the app, Styles are all over the place.

There should be a better way to handle routing in the app with Named route but for simplicity and rapidity. I did'nt used it.

Dart syntax is easy to learn I really love using it.

I tried to add the possibility to add multiple tag to one note but it was too much for this small project. The tag views wwas meant to be clickable to see notes inside, and the plus icon could create a new group.

Overall it was a great experience and I look forward to play more with Flutter in the Future !

I hope you like the 'final' product â˜º
